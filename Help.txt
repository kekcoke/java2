1. Problem. 
	I have an update method that makes the changes, 
		implementation works for getting adjacentcells ONE-BY-ONE. Not entities though as there already is an arraylist (static/non-static?).
		If I do this, one taketurn, one cell object, all entities are iterated.
        I can't invoke update using existing cell object in world ([][]).
		
		SOLUTION DON'T ITERATE THRU ALL ENTITY ARRAYLIST. JUST ONE AT A TIME. TUTOR kinda SOUNDED THOUGH THAT YOU GONNA ITERATE WHOLE.
		
		Another possible solution, if I update only the first cell index object, then I can't iterate adjacentcells but invoke methods for entities. 
			Problem here is that entity methods don't have access to cell location to retrieve , even as I give params (can't loop & increment here too).
			it's harder to keep track of what's happening.
			Can't retrieve location from entity class.
	    
		
		First solution makes more sense, but can't wrap my head around this one.
	

LOGIC.
REMOVE HERBIVORES.
SEED. GROW.
MOVE HERBIVORES. EAT OR DIE
